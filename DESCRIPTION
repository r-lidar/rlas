Description: Read and write 'las' and 'laz' binary file formats. The LAS file format is a public file format for the interchange of 3-dimensional point cloud data between data users. The LAS specifications are approved by the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing <https://www.asprs.org/committee-general/laser-las-file-format-exchange-activities.html>. The LAZ file format is an open and lossless compression scheme for binary LAS format versions 1.0 to 1.3 <https://www.laszip.org/>.
